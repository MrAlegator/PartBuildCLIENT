# PartBuildCLIENT
PartBuildCLIENT Script (ROBLOX)

This is my own GUI with various funny built-in scripts of mine, created on the Orion library and made specifically for the roblox client. Most of the features here are visual! Therefore, rather, at most, it is a visual script! It's completely free and doesn't have any key system, it's also easy to use!
